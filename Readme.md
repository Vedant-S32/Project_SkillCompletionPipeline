# Project Skill Completion Pipeline 'Powered by You'

Welcome to the Project Skill Completion Pipeline repository! Hi, this is my first year college project on the theme "Inovative Idea". This project aims to revolutionize the way we approach online learning by providing a structured and streamlined platform for skill acquisition. The overwhelming abundance of online learning resources often leaves learners uncertain about where to begin, what to learn next, and whether a course is worth their time. The Skill Completion Pipeline addresses these challenges by offering a curated repository of learning resources and a well-defined learning path for users of all skill levels.

## Developer Comment

This is my first year college project on theme "Inovative Idea". The of repository of learning resources born from my frustrations of issues mentioned above. This project still has some unaddressed edge cases. I wanted to use Godot for the project and it was very frustrating as this the first thing I made without copy pasting tutorial, there were hardly any tutorials for this, I read documentations and figured out stuffs on my own but it was fun. Feel free to explore my messy code.
